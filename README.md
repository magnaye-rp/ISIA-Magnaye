# My Expectations to System Integration and Architecture

#### What I am expecting in this subject is that it will teach us how to manage the systems that we will create. I think that it will help us build our systems until we are able to push it to production. I also believe that we will also learn different techniques to make a plan on how to build scalable systems that will use different models.
